This comprehensive Python code implements the complete AI-powered reliability methodology for the stepped shaft problem. It includes:
Monte Carlo Simulation with 10,000 iterations considering all variations
Analytical Stress Calculations with stress concentration factors
Fatigue Life Prediction using Basquin's equation
Weibull Reliability Analysis to determine B10 life and other metrics
Sample Size Determination for physical validation testing
Accelerated Test Planning with specific recommendations
Comprehensive Visualization of all results
The code provides a complete workflow from virtual simulation to physical test planning, exactly as described in the article. You can run this code directly to analyze your own shaft design problems or adapt it for other mechanical components.
